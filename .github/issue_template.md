### DISCLAIMER:
This list contains *all* domains that use cloudflare DNS, not just the cloudflare SSL proxy (the affected service that leaked data).
It's a broad sweeping list that includes everything.  Just because a domain is on the list does not mean the site is compromised.
This list will be narrowed down to the affected domains as I get more information.


### HOW TO REMOVE YOUR SITE
If your domain name is listed but it wasn't using any of the Cloudflare reverse proxy features, 
this is how to remove your website from the list:
If I've made a mistake and you believe your site is not affected, submit a PR and I will merge it ASAP, 
I don't want to hurt anyone's reputation unecessarily.
